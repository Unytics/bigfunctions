## üîçÔ∏è What is BigFunctions?

BigFunctions is both:

> 1. **Some Open-Source BigQuery functions (üí™ hello SQL-superpowers) callable without install from any GCP project**
> 2. **A framework to define, test, deploy, document and monitor your own BigQuery functions** (in addition to the ones available in this repo). üëâ BigFunctions Framework Features:
>     1. üíö **A standard to define BigQuery routines as yaml files be it sql/js/remote UDF or procedures**
>     2. üíö **`bigfun`: a CLI (Command Line Interface) to test, deploy, document and monitor these BigQuery routines in your project**


<br>


## üí° Why BigFunctions?

BigQuery, with native and remote routines, is really powerful. **BigFunctions take the most of that by offering ready-to-use functions holding useful features for data-teams**.

We believe no-one should be reinventing the wheel and open-source is the best way to fight against that. Hey Data-People! Let's share our work, help each other and inspire from each other. üëâ Play and contribute to BigFunctions!

<br>

## üëÄ Call public BigFunctions without install from you GCP project

All BigFunctions represented by a 'yaml' file in 'bigfunctions' folder are automatically deployed in public datasets so that you can call them directly without install from your BigQuery project. 

To explore available bigfunctions and to get started, visit **<a href="https://unytics.github.io/bigfunctions/" target="_blank">BigFunctions website</a>**.

<br>


## üöÄ Deploy BigFunctions in your GCP project

To deploy a bigfunction named 'my_bigfunction' defined as a yaml file located in 'bigfunctions' folder simply call:

``` sh
bigfun deploy my_bigfunction
```

Details about `bigfun` command line are given below.

<br>


## üí• `bigfun` CLI

This repo contains a CLI (command-line-interface) called `bigfun` to facilitate BigFunctions development, test, deployment, documentation and monitoring.

### Install `bigfun` üõ†Ô∏è

**Install dependencies**

`bigfun` invokes `gcloud` CLI to deploy remote functions. Furthermore, `bigfun` uses BigQuery python client using your default *gcloud app credentials*.

Thus, for `bigfun` to work, please:

- install `gcloud`
- authenticate `gcloud` by running `gcloud init`
- create your default app credentials by running `gcloud auth application-default login`.

**Install `bigfun`**

Clone the repo and from the repo directory run:

``` sh
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install --editable .
```

**Get needed permissions**

[TODO]


### Use `bigfun` üî•

``` sh
$ bigfun --help
Usage: bigfun [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  deploy  Deploy BIGFUNCTION
  doc     Generate, serve and publish documentation
  test    Test BIGFUNCTION
```
