  Returns percentile of an array with percentile a float in range [0, 1].
  
  Algorithm to calculate percentile is based on *[R. J. Hyndman and Y. Fan, "Sample quantiles in statistical packages," The American Statistician, 50(4), pp. 361-365, 1996](https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/129116/original/Sample+Quantiles.pdf)*
arguments:
  - name: arr
    type: any type
  - name: percentile
    type: float64
output:
  name: percentile_value
  type: float64
examples:

    arguments:
      - "[20, 16, 15, 13, 10, 9, 8, 8, 7, 6, 3]"
