  Calculate the distance from Benford's Law for a given column of numeric data.
  This function computes the Chi-square distance between the observed distribution of leading digits and the expected distribution according to Benford's Law.
arguments:
  - name: numeric_column
    type: array<float64>
output:
  name: benfords_distance
  type: float64
examples:
  - description: "Calculate Benford's distance for order total prices"
    arguments:
      - "array(select o_totalprice from `tpch.orders`)"
    output: "0.0012"
  - description: "Calculate Benford's distance for sales amounts"
    arguments:
      - "array(select sale_amount from `tpch.sales`)"
    output: "0.0034"
  - description: "Calculate Benford's distance for transaction values"
    arguments:
      - "array(select transaction_value from `tpch.transactions`)"
    output: "0.0021"
